            <div>
                <h3>Vaccination Requirements</h3>
                <p>Puppies must have their first Distemper Combination and Bordetella vaccination at least 7 days prior to their first day of Puppy Preschool and must be kept up to date during their time at Tailz.</p>
                <p>Historically, puppies weren't to socialize until after their third set of vaccines, however, research now shows that waiting this long has had detrimental effects on social skills.</p>
