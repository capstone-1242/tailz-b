        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Why does Tailz need copies of vaccination records? Will my dog's rabies tag work?</h3>
            <p>We respect the trust our clients have in us. We also understand that saying the vaccinations were done is not the same as knowing when the vaccinations were in fact administered and when they are due next. The details on a rabies tag do not provide us with enough information to count as proof.</p>
            <p>We use a computerized system to help us keep track of when they are due next. This gives our clients the peace of mind they deserve knowing all dogs in our care are vaccinated according to their veterinarian's schedule.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Will the vaccinations I did myself work?</h3>
            <p>They may work, however, we require proof of purchase (the till receipt) and the sticker from the vaccination vile. Without both parts, we cannot accept the self-administered vaccine. We will also count vaccines as valid for only 1 year from the day of purchase.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Do you have a littles area?</h3>
            <p>Yes, we do! Little ones have an area fenced off and exclusively dedicateed to them adn boy do they love it! Play structures that are more suited to their smaller structures are available for them to play on.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How are dogs grouped together?</h3>
            <p>We separate dogs according to size and play style</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Are dogs free to roam?</h3>
            <p>Think of us like a supervised off leash park. We do have crates, however they are mostly used to allow a dog to have their own personal space to nap, or occasionally for a time out.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What techniques do your Canine Play Specialists use when handling dogs?</h3>
            <p>It is our mission to use scientifically-based techniques when handling the dogs. This means absolutely no dominating, no alpha-rolling, and no Cesar Milan anything. These are all techniques that can and often do cause fear and negative association for dogs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is your philosophy on dog training and handling?</h3>
            <p>At Tailz, we believe in treating animals with the kindness and respect they deserve. It is our mandate to cause no undue harm or stress to an animal in our care. You may see us ask for your dog to have manners. Kindly offer our team your patience while we work with your dog during its stay including at home time. Fortunately, repetition works... it just needs time :)</p>
